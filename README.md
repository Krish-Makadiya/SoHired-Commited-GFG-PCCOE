## 🌍 The Problem (SDG-8 Context)
The gig economy often exploits talent through "speculative work"—asking for custom designs and solutions with zero guarantee of pay. This creates a barrier for talented individuals who cannot afford to work for free. **FairLink** solves this by bridging the gap between companies and creators with a transparent, AI-vetted, and financially fair ecosystem.

## ✨ Key Features
* **AI Submission Scorecard:** Recruiters receive instant, data-backed technical evaluations of applicant proposals using **Gemini 2.0 Flash**.
* **Fair Selection Workflow:** Automatic "Participation Compensation" for shortlisted finalists, ensuring everyone’s time is valued.
* **Transparent Milestones:** Real-time project tracking with integrated payment releases at every stage.
* **Skill-Match Engine:** Smart filtering that connects the right developer to the right project based on technical depth.
* **Direct Submission Review:** Rich previews for Figma and GitHub links directly within the Recruiter Dashboard.
